    <p>Though daunting at first, creating this website turned out to be a very enjoyable process. Before starting the course I was very excited for this module as I am greatly interested in the graphic design elements of this course and this module has provided me with the opportunity to work on my graphic design skills as well as to develop skills in an area that is completely new to me with web design.</p>
    
    <p>The CARP and typography tasks were my favourite parts of this assignment as one of my main motivations for doing this course was to increase my knowledge of using the Adobe programs. Using both Illustrator and InDesign were new to me and I had to take time to learn how to use the software in order to complete both of these tasks. </p>

    <p>The other part of this assignment was the coding sheets which were extremely helpful for me to learn about web design and how to code a website. I enjoyed the practical side of this task as I feel that I learn much better when I am putting what I am learning into practice. </p>
